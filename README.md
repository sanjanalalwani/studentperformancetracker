# Student Performance Tracker
This is a website which helps the students to track their own performance.
This website also allows the students to create their own schedules for the day.

Once logged in the student can see three buttons

One of which is the My Performance. This button directs the student to the page where he/she can see his/her performance. The student can input his/her marks and check his performance

 The next button is the source for Study Materials. Here the student can find youtube links/pdfs all at one single place. These links will not only help them in studies but also they have links for improving soft skills.
